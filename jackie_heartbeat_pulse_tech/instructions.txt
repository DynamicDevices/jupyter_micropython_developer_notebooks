1. Try green light pulse sensors in an oscilloscope
to see how to get a clean signal


2. Use
    commissioning_new_esp32
to get a new ESP32 working if it does not hape MicroPython   


3. Work through the ESP32-MicroPython operating notebook
    make_adc_readings.ipynb
to make some test measurements from a single pulse sensor on a pin


4. It can save measurements to a file.
Then you can use the PC-Normal Python notebook on your PC:
    plot_adc_measurements
to read and plot this file
    
    
5. Here is some more advanced code for acquiring multiple measurements 
from multiple pulse sensors at the same time and saving to a file
    make_multi_adc_readings
    
6. The next bit of work is in on the PC with the file with:
    plot_multi_measurements
This will read and plot multiple sets of data.  
You need to set t0,t1 to the time seconds with the good data

We will now explore how to generate interesting correlations from pulses 
from different parts of the body and plot colourful graphs
