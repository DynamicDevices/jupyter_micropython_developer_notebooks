1. Try green light pulse sensors in an oscilloscope
to see how to get a clean signal

2. Use
    commissioning_new_esp32
to get a new ESP32 working    

3. Work through 
    make_adc_readings.ipynb
to make some test measurements
    
4. The measurements will be saved to a file, so use:
    plot_adc_measurements
to plot them
    
    
5. Code for acquiring multiple measurements that are smoothed
    make_multi_adc_readings
